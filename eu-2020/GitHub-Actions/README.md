# Deploying a CF App via GitHub Actions

In this hands-on lab, you will learn all about GitHub Actions, a
lightweight, public-cloud CI/CD-as-a-service run by everyone's
favorite code hosting service: GitHub.

We'll be using GitHub to push an application to the Hands-on Lab
Cloud Foundry installation.

## What You Need

  1. A web browser
  2. A (free!) GitHub account (<https://github.com/join>)

## What We Will Provide

  1. A CF application that is ready to rock and roll ðŸ¤˜
  2. Credentials to your own Cloud Foundry Space
  3. Instruction / Guidance / Mentorship / Jokes

## The Lab (In All Of Its Glory)

Here's what we're going to do:

  1. Learn what GitHub Actions is, and (roughly) how it works
  2. Clone the application repository
  3. Configure our CF credentials as GitHUb Secrets
  4. Explore the Actions Workflow that came with the forked repo
  5. Make a small change
  6. Watch GitHub do our bidding
  7. Visit our beautiful new application
  8. Celebrate ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ
